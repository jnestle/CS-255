  The DriverPass project was a system analysis and design project for a hypothetical client, DriverPass, which aimed to help students better prepare for their driving tests. Their research showed that many students fail the exam because they only study past tests rather than gaining practical experience. To address this, DriverPass wanted a Learning Management System (LMS) that would provide online practice exams and on-the-road training. The system included multiple stakeholders, such as administrators, instructors, students, and a payment system. Each actor had specific use cases, such as students registering and verifying their emails, instructors tracking student progress, administrators assigning lessons, and the payment system processing transactions.

  One area I did particularly well was creating clear and organized system design documents, including UML use case diagrams that accurately represented user interactions. These diagrams helped illustrate how different actors would interact with the system and ensured that all requirements were covered. If I could revise one part of my work, I would refine the business requirements document to be more detailed, especially in specifying functional and non-functional requirements. This would provide an even clearer roadmap for development and help prevent ambiguity in later stages.

  Interpreting user needs was a key part of the design process, and I achieved this by closely analyzing the interview data and translating it into system functionalities. Understanding user needs is critical in software design because it ensures the system is practical, efficient, and user-friendly. A system that does not align with user expectations will ultimately fail, regardless of its technical capabilities. In the future, I would approach system design by incorporating more user feedback loops, creating wireframes for early validation, and using agile methodologies to allow for iterative improvements. These strategies would enhance the clarity, usability, and effectiveness of the final product.
